# Pickle -- Cucumber for Perl 6

## Introduction

A library to implement a Cucumber-like BDD test framework in Perl 6.
This was once a part of my [PSpec](https://github.com/supernovus/PSpec/) 
project, but has been spun off into its own repository.

## Status

This is currently non-functional. I've just ripped any Pickle-specific files
out of PSpec and dumped them into this repository. No work has been done to
actually get them working again.
